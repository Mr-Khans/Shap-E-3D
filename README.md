# Shape-E: A Conditional Generative Model for 3D Assets
Shap-E a conditional generative model for 3D assets
Shape-E is a conditional generative model for 3D assets. It is designed to generate high-quality 3D models of various types, including objects, furniture, and even buildings. The model takes a set of conditions as input and generates a corresponding 3D model.

# Installation
To use Shape-E, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following packages installed:

TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
PIL (Python Imaging Library)

# Acknowledgments
Shape-E was inspired by several existing generative models for 3D assets, including:

GAN-3D
3D-GAN
PointFlow
